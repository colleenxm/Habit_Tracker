#Project Proposal
## Brief Overview
I plan to build a habit tracker for users to create goals and check in regularly over a period of time, ending with a visual representation
of their commitment to their habits, like the hand written example below.

</p>
## Anticipated Steps
1) Build interface for users to add goals
2) Access date for tracking purposes using world clock API
2) Create file to store user data and make app access/pretty print user data given user name
3) Build graph and buttons for user to check off their completion of a habit on a given day.
4) Integrate quote API to having opening screen of app display motivation quote
5) Add customization of length of time for tracking (ie basic app would track/display a week at a time, but ideally users can track a whole
month if they wanted to.)
6) Allow for user color-coding
