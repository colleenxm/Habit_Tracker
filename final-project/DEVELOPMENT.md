* Fixed debug-lib problem by reinstalling openframeworks. 
* Discovered bug in project generator that was causing project to be built without proper library dependencies. 
* Replaced old version of openframeworks and now the proper libraries are there.
* Also downloaded ofxJSON, the JSON.cpp wrapper for openframeworks.

* Wrote getter and setter methods for the user class to access parts of habit struct.
* Wrote habitCreator, trackCurrentDay, createJson, fileExists and getUserName. 
* File exsits and get user name were code taken from naive bayes mp. 
* Roadblock in back end - cannot figure out how to write to a json file. 
* Switching to work on GUI for a bit because currently is just the GUI example from ofxGUI. May use ofxDATGUI.
