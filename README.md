## Overview 
I built a habit tracking app, which allows users to enter how many habits they would like to track and the names of each habit, and then check in periodically to record their progress. They can then see a simple, charted representation of their progress with each habit. 

## Requirements
* OpenFrameworks version 0.10.1 or higher. Some other versions of OpenFrameworks may generate errors. To install OpenFrameworks, follow the instructions at http://openframeworks.cc/download/ 

You will need to add ofxGui and ofxJSON to the project using OpenFrameworks. To do so, open OpenFrameworks' projectGenerator app (path/to/of/download/projectGenerator-osx or a similar path if you're installing this on another OS), import this project, and select ofxGui and ofxJSON under the drop-down menu in the Addons section.

## Installation
Installation is quite straightforward.
Steps:
1. git clone https://github.com/uiuc-sp19-cs126/final-project-colleenxm
2. Open in Microsoft Visual Studio or a similar IDE through OpenFramework's projectGenerator app.
3. Run.

## Code Style
I used  Google C++ Style Guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). Note that methods required by OpenFrameworks deviate from this style.

## Demo
For the sake of time, I only put the first and last stages of the app in the gif. First is when you are a new user, you create a user name and add the habits that you would like to track. Then, you check off whether or not you did them that day. The gif then pauses and skips to a further date in to better show the progress, although with regular use you can see that you can only track the progress one day at a time. In the second part of the gif, the app gets data from the JSON file created earlier with the user's name and asks for progress on the same habits, and then shows how the progress ocurred over a number of days.

## Citations
I used https://github.com/ElizWang/Enhanced_Pacman as an example for proper formatting in regards to all of my .md files, as well as an example for creating buttons. 

This example from ofxJSON https://github.com/jeffcrouse/ofxJSON/tree/master/example_file_read_write was also extremely useful in my code, as demonstrated writing to a JSON file using ofxJSON. 

I used ofxCenteredTrueTypeFont (https://github.com/armadillu/ofxCenteredTrueTypeFont) to format the text. I cloned this and added it in src/header_addons. 

## Erratum
NOTE FOR MY STUDENTS: My project is by no means perfect. It is a little too simple, and there are some mistakes for sure. DO NOT use my code as a reference for perfect style. If you have any questions, email me.
* Some instances of naming not adhering to the style guide 
* In a few places I passed objects by value instead of by reference
* I should have included a white line after each method declaration
* Enums do not require line comments because the names should be self-documenting enough
* In HabitTracker.cpp line 303-321 should have used switch because it doesnâ€™t make sense for more than one if statement to be true
* PrettyPrintHabitBoxes() has way, way too many layers of nesting. I should have made a vector of colors and taken the index of the corresponding color instead of hard coding a switch statement (lines 389 - 400) 
* I did not consistently use @param and @return in all of my documentation
* My commit messages should have only included what *was* implemented. Things that were not yet implemented should be in DEVELOPMENT.md
* Some commit messages had typos, and did not always describe everything that was changed
* I should have only changed one file per commit (this is why I had few commits - I was changing multiple files per commit which is bad practice and resulted in me having a pretty low number of commits)
